Each pseudopod can hold a one-handed item, or the two pseudopods together can hold a two-handed item.</p><p>By default, this works the same way as other ancestries do in terms of holding and manipulating items, though, at the GM's discretion, some manipulate actions might be easier for a slime and some might be more difficult. You make pseudopod unarmed attacks instead of fist unarmed attacks, though they otherwise have the same statistics.</p>"
