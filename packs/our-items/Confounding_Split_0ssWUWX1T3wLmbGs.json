      "value": "<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per hour</p><hr /><p>You split into four versions of yourself, three of which are simply mindless piles of goop ready to be splatted to protect you from harm. The duplicates last for up to one minute. They move throughout your space, making it impossible to tell which of you is which without the use of true seeing or another effect that sees through the transmutation. This causes those who attack you to sometimes hit one of the duplicates instead of you. If all three duplicates remain, there is a 1 in 4 chance of hitting you (1 on 1d4). With two remaining, there is a 1 in 3 chance of hitting you (1-2 on 1d6). With only one duplicate, the chances are 1 in 2 (1-3 on 1d6). Once a duplicate is hit, it is destroyed. If an attack roll fails to hit your AC but doesn't critically fail, it destroys a duplicate but has no additional effect (even if the attack would normally have an effect on a failure). If an attack roll is a critical success and would hit one of the duplicates, one of the duplicates is destroyed and the attack roll becomes a success against you.</p><p>This effect isn't cumulative with mirror image. While you have any duplicates from Confounding Split, you can't use mirror image, and vice versa.</p>"
