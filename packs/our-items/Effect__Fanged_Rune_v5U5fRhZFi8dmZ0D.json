By putting a <em>fanged</em> weapon in your mouth, you can transform into an animal.</p><hr /><p><strong>Activate</strong> <span class=\"action-glyph\">1</span> Interact (magical, polymorph, transmutation)</p><hr /><p><strong>Effect</strong> You transform into a Small or Medium animal that wields the <em>fanged</em> weapon in its jaws; the animal matches the animal you are most closely associated with (a lizardfolk would turn into a lizard, a kitsune into a fox, a deer instinct barbarian into a deer, etc.) or a wolf if no specific animal is applicable. While in this form, you can attack with the <em>fanged</em> weapon even though you don't have any hands. However, you can attack only with the <em>fanged</em> weapon and you don't have hands or the ability to hold items. For effects dependent on how many hands you are using to hold the item, such as the two-hand trait, you are holding the weapon in two hands. You can Dismiss this effect, and it ends automatically if you drop the <em>fanged</em> weapon (whether or not of your own volition).</p>"
