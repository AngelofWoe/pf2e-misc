      "value": "<h2>Eldritch Shadow Spellcasting</h2><p>Your magical skill with the shadow provides you with arcane magical power. You are a spellcaster and can cast spells of the arcane tradition using the Cast a Spell activity. As an eldritch shadow, you draw your power from the shadows, and excel at spells that attack and confuse your foes. As such, you may add any spells with the Shadow trait to your spells you have access to, regardless of what tradition they belong to. However, you may not learn or use any spell with the Light trait.</p><p><span style=\"font-family:Roboto, sans-serif\">Each day, you can cast up to two 1st-rank spells. You must know spells to cast them, and you learn them via the spell repertoire class feature. The number of spells you can cast each day is called your spell slots.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:Roboto, sans-serif\">As you increase in level as an eldritch shadow, your number of spells per day increases, as does the highest rank of spells you can cast, as shown on the Eldritch Shadow Spells per Day table.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:Roboto, sans-serif\">Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack to see how effective they are, or have your enemies roll against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving throw). Since your key attribute is Charisma, your spell attack modifier and spell DC use your Charisma modifier.</span></p><h3>Heightening Spells</h3><p>When you get spell slots of 2nd rank and higher, you can fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-rank spells. This increases the spell's rank, heightening it to match the spell slot. You must have a spell in your spell repertoire at the rank you want to cast it in order to heighten it to that rank. Many spells have specific improvements when they are heightened to certain ranks. The signature spells class feature lets you heighten certain spells freely.</p><h3>Cantrips</h3><p>Some of your spells are cantrips. A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn't use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day. A cantrip is always automatically heightened to half your level rounded upâ€”this is usually equal to the highest rank of sorcerer spell slot you have. For example, as a 1st-level eldritch shadow, your cantrips are 1st-rank spells, and as a 5th-level eldritch shadow, your cantrips are 3rd-rank spells.</p><p></p><table class=\"pf2e\"><thead><tr><th>Your Level</th><th>Cantrips</th><th>1st</th><th>2nd</th><th>3rd</th><th>4th</th><th>5th</th><th>6th</th><th>7th</th><th>8th</th><th>9th</th><th>10th</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>5</td><td>2</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>5</td><td>3</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>5</td><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>5</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>5</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>5</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>5</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>5</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>5</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>5</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>11</td><td>5</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>12</td><td>5</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>13</td><td>5</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>14</td><td>5</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>15</td><td>5</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>16</td><td>5</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>17</td><td>5</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>18</td><td>5</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>19</td><td>5</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>1*</td></tr><tr><td>20</td><td>5</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>1*</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"12\">* The shadow paragon <span id=\"ctl00_RadDrawer1_Content_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">class feature gives you a 10th-level spell slot that works differently from other spell slots.</span></td></tr></tbody></table>"
