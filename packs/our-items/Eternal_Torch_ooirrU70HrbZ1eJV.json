It's as bright and hot as a torch. You can have it orbit a target willing creature or emit from a target object that's unattended or attended by a willing creature. If you create a flame on a weapon, you still need to use it as an improvised weapon to attack with the flame, just as with a torch.</p>\n<p>The flame has an unlimited duration. You can have a maximum number of Eternal Torches equal to your Constitution modifier, and you can Dismiss each torch individually.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Level (8th)</strong> All your torches—even ones you already created—shed bright light in a 60-foot radius (and dim light for the next 60 feet).</p>"
