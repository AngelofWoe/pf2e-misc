When the target would regain Hit Points, such as from a healing effect or an ability like fast healing or regeneration, it must attempt a @Check[will|against:exemplar] save against your class DC to determine the effects, and then the marking fades. The marking otherwise fades after 1 minute.</p><hr /><p><strong>Critical Success </strong>The creature regains the full number of Hit Points that would be healed.</p><p><strong>Success</strong> The creature regains only half the number of Hit Points as the contradictory energies swirl within it.</p><p><strong>Failure</strong> The creature doesn't regain any Hit Points.</p><p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> The creature loses half the Hit Points they would have been healed.</p>"
